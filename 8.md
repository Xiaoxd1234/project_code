[Set 4] Task 8: Adventure Turn Logic (19 marks)
Overview
In this task, you will implement a turn-based game mechanic by simulating random events that affect the player's state. This builds on previous tasks by introducing more complex function logic, dictionary mutation, and conditional control.

Task Description
Do not use the shuffle method from the random library just the two methods that have been imported in the specification.
Also please use the following list with the exact ordering:
events = ["find_item", "take_damage", "heal", "nothing"]

Write a Python program that:

Defines a function play_turn(player_state) that accepts the player_state dictionary.

Randomly selects one of the following events during the turn:

The player finds an item (add a random item to the player's inventory)

After adding an item to the player inventory the items list is unchanged (it's not removed)

The player takes damage (reduce health by a random amount between 1 and 5 inclusive)

Should health - damage be < 0 set it to 0 instead (See example three instead of having -1 health we have 0 health)

Use randint for this

The player heals (increase health by a random amount between 1 and 3 inclusive)

Health cannot exceed max health

Use randint for this

Nothing happens (state remains unchanged)

Updates the player_state dictionary in-place to reflect the event.

Prints a clear summary of what happened during the turn, including changes to health or inventory.

 play_turn(state) is called either 5 times or until the player's health is zero.

Should all 5 turns complete then print out the final health and inventory.

If the player reaches 0 or less on the fifth turn do not print out the final health and inventory instead <Player name> has no health left. Game Over.

If the player’s health reaches 0, print a message indicating the game is over and stop early.

Requirements
You must use a function named play_turn(state).

You must use a for loop to execute turns (not a while loop).

Use random.choice() or random.randint() to introduce variability.

All changes must be made directly to the passed player_state dictionary.

The summary output must be descriptive and indicate what occurred and what changed.

-- Turn 4 --

-- Turn 1 --

Turn Event: heal
Rupert healed 2. Health: 12.

-- Turn 2 --

Turn Event: take_damage
Rupert took 2 damage. Health: 10.

-- Turn 3 --

Turn Event: take_damage
Rupert took 1 damage. Health: 9.

-- Turn 4 --

Turn Event: heal
Rupert healed 2. Health: 11.

-- Turn 5 --

Turn Event: take_damage
Rupert took 2 damage. Health: 9.

Final Health: 9
Final Inventory: Empty.

Assumptions
player_state will always contain valid keys and values (these are described in the previous task)

Your function must not return a new dictionary; it should mutate the passed one

The player_state dictionary will be replaced in testing








          
【第4组】任务8：冒险回合逻辑（19分）

概述
在本任务中，你将通过模拟影响玩家状态的随机事件，来实现一个回合制游戏机制。这是在前面任务基础上，进一步引入更复杂的函数逻辑、字典变更和条件控制。

任务描述
不要使用random库中的shuffle方法，只能用规范中已导入的两个方法。
请使用如下顺序的列表：
events = ["find_item", "take_damage", "heal", "nothing"]

编写一个Python程序：

定义一个函数play_turn(player_state)，接收player_state字典。

每回合随机选择以下事件之一：
- 玩家找到物品（向玩家物品栏添加一个随机物品）
  添加物品后，物品列表不变（不会移除）
- 玩家受到伤害（生命值减少1到5之间的随机值，包含1和5）
  若health - damage < 0，则设为0（如示例三，生命值不会为-1而是0）
  用randint实现
- 玩家治疗（生命值增加1到3之间的随机值，包含1和3）
  生命值不能超过最大生命值
  用randint实现
- 什么都没发生（状态不变）

所有事件都需直接在player_state字典上进行变更。

每回合需打印发生了什么，包括生命值或物品栏的变化。

play_turn(state)要么被调用5次，要么直到玩家生命值为0。

如果5回合全部完成，则打印最终生命值和物品栏。
如果玩家在第5回合生命值为0或更低，则不打印最终生命值和物品栏，而是输出“<玩家名> has no health left. Game Over.”
如果玩家生命值在过程中变为0，则输出游戏结束信息并提前停止。

要求
- 必须使用play_turn(state)函数名。
- 必须用for循环执行回合（不能用while循环）。
- 用random.choice()或random.randint()实现随机性。
- 所有变更必须直接作用于传入的player_state字典。
- 输出需描述清楚发生了什么以及变化内容。

假设
player_state始终包含有效键和值（见前一任务描述）
你的函数不能返回新字典，必须直接修改传入的字典
player_state字典会在测试时被替换
