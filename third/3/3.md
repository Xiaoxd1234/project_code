Task 3 - Search Made Easy [10 marks]
Your library system is steadily evolving. Users can now log in, borrow, and return books with ease. But one problem remains: finding the right book isn't always so easy. The current search function only works if users know the exact title. Imagine being a stressed student during exam week, remembering only "something about machine learning" but not the full book title -- frustrating, right?

The librarians want to fix this by introducing a keyword-based search, so users can explore the catalogue more naturally. On top of that, the university has just secured extra funding to expand the collection, and your system must now support adding brand-new books into the database.

Task Description
Updated Main Menu 
For students, staff (non-library) and other users, a new option, Search by Keywords (Option 5), is added to the main menu.

Enter your choice:

Renew loan
All users may renew each borrowed book once, using the command renew <book ID> in the Borrow and Return console.

Renewal extends the due date by 5 days.

If the user has borrowed multiple copies of the same book, the system will renew the copy (or loan) with the earliest due date first.

A book is not eligible for renewal if:

Its extended due date has already passed (making it overdue). An error message "Renewal denied: This book is already overdue." will be printed out instead.

If it is already renewed once by the user, the system will display "Renewal unavailable: Each book can only be renewed once."

Users with unpaid fines cannot renew any loans until their fines are settled. The system will display "Renewal denied: You have unpaid fines."

Returning validation priority is similar to borrowing validation priority in Task 2.

The system first checks whether the user is eligible to renew.

Then it verifies if the loan is valid and is eligible to renew.

Search by Keywords
Upon entering 5,  the system will prompt them to enter a list of keywords (case insensitive), separated by commas (,). The program will then search the catalogue and return a list of books that contain at least one of the specified keywords.

The results will be sorted in the following order of priority:

Number of matched keywords (highest first)

Publication year (newest first)

Book ID (ascending order)

If the keyword list is empty, the program should return "Found 0 book(s)."

Manage Library (Library Staff only)
When staff members select option 6 to enter the Manage Library console, they can perform the following actions:

Print library report by enter report

Add a New Book

Use the command add physical to add a new physical book, or add online to add a new online book.

The system will then prompt the user to provide the bookâ€™s details, including  title, authors, year, number of copies (required for physical books only)

The system will automatically assign keywords to newly added books by matching any words in their titles with the existing keyword list from the books.csv dataset (sorted by alphabet order).

Each new book is assigned a unique ID:

IDs for physical books begin with P.

IDs for online books begin with E.

The numeric portion of the ID is generated by incrementing the highest existing ID of that type in the library.

Type quit to exit the borrow and return console and go back to main menu.
